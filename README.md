## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here's Hans, nice to read you!

I'm an IT professional/enthusiast  with a special interest in Web Security and (Identity) Access Management.


During the morning, you'll find me drinking a lot (coffee ;-)

Printers hate me, they are not a friend of mine. Google is my friend though.

When my laptop is overheated, you'll find me outside in the yard, going for a run (for ever doing "start-to-run"), practicing yoga (although I'm just in it for Savasana!)
